        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Abhijeet Parida.<br>
           I am studying at the National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar, where I am in my first year of an Integrated Masters degree in Science.<br>
           I am interested in Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science. 
           I also like playing games, especially with friends. Football is my favourite sport, although I struggle with all the running around. I also indulge in anime/manga occasionally, and read light novels once in a while. <br>
           After joining the Software Development Group in NISER, I am invested in learning web and app dev. I also plan on making a good game with my friends. I am also interested in learning about AI and ML, and plan on working on them in the future.<br>
           My favourite fruits are watermelon and pineapple, and I love eating noodles as well.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p> I plan on working on projects this winter in internships, where I will try to make a GUI interface for some lab equipment. For this I need to learn some matplotlib and numpy to plot graphs too.<br>
            I am also going to do an internship under NISER's Coding Club, where we will work together and try to create an app for all the facilities offered by our SDG.<br> 
            Here's wishing to a productive Winter break!<br></p>
